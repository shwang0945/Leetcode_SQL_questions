SELECT p.project_id, p.employee_id
FROM (SELECT p.project_id, e.name, Max(e.experience_years) As years
FROM Project p , Employee e
WHERE p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id) a JOIN Project p ON a. project_id = p.project_id JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE a.years = e.experience_years

Others:

from Project p join Employee e
on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
where (p.project_id, e.experience_years) in (
    select a.project_id, max(b.experience_years)
    from Project a join Employee b
    on a.employee_id = b.employee_id
    group by a.project_id);

FROM Events
GROUP BY event_type) a ON e.event_type = a.event_type
WHERE e.occurences  > a.average_occurences
GROUP BY business_id HAVING COUNT(e.event_type) >1  

Others:

My Answer: (MS SQL)

SELECT player_id,event_date, SUM(games_played)over(partition by player_id ORDER BY event_date) As games_played_so_far
FROM Activity 

MySQL
select a1.player_id, a1.event_date, sum(a2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from activity as a1
inner join activity as a2
on a1.event_date >= a2.event_date
and a1.player_id = a2.player_id
group by  a1.player_id, a1.event_date


177. Nth Highest Salary


MySQL:

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;
SET M=N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT M, 1
  );
END

****************
SELECT 
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
LIMIT [offset,] row_count;
****************




???
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    /* Write your T-SQL query statement below. */
    select COALESCE(SALARY,NULL) 
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    GROUP BY SALARY
    ORDER BY SALARY DESC
    OFFSET @N-1 ROWS FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY
);

**************************
The OFFSET clause specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows from the query. The offset_row_count can be a constant, variable, or parameter that is greater or equal to zero.
The FETCH clause specifies the number of rows to return after the OFFSET clause has been processed. The offset_row_count can a constant, variable or scalar that is greater or equal to one.
The OFFSET clause is mandatory while the FETCH clause is optional. Also, the FIRST and NEXT are synonyms respectively so you can use them interchangeably. Similarly, you can use the FIRST and NEXT interchangeably.


CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      
    
      SELECT e1.Salary
      FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee) e1
      WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee) e2 WHERE e2.Salary > e1.Salary) = N - 1      
      
      LIMIT 1
